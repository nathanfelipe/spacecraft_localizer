## Abstract
The paper investigates the dynamics of interplanetary gas and magnetic fields in response to Biermann’s hypothesis that gas streams outward from the Sun at velocities between 500-1500 km/s. The study explores how the solar corona's high temperature (∼3×10⁶ K) leads to continuous plasma outflows, now known as the **solar wind**, and how this influences the structure of the interplanetary magnetic field.

## Key Concepts and Findings

### 1. **Outflow of Gas from the Sun**
- Biermann suggested that gas escapes radially from the Sun, influencing comet tails.
- Densities of ∼500 hydrogen atoms/cm³ at Earth's orbit imply a solar mass loss rate of ∼10¹⁴-10¹⁵ g/s.
- The energy associated with this outflow is vastly greater than the energy needed to heat the corona.

### 2. **Hydrodynamic Expansion and Energy Considerations**
- The gas outflow can be explained by coronal temperatures exceeding 10⁶ K.
- The pressure at infinity cannot balance the coronal pressure, necessitating a steady expansion.
- The outflow velocity exceeds the solar escape velocity and reaches up to 1000 km/s.
- A spherical hydrodynamic model confirms that even modest coronal heating can sustain this expansion.

### 3. **Magnetic Field and Solar Wind Interaction**
- The outward-moving plasma drags the Sun's magnetic field lines outward, creating a **radial interplanetary magnetic field**.
- The field lines become increasingly wound into a **spiral structure** due to the Sun’s rotation (later known as the Parker Spiral).
- Near the Sun, the field remains mostly radial, but at larger distances, the azimuthal component grows.
- The estimated field strength falls as B ~ r⁻².

### 4. **Plasma Instabilities and Cosmic Rays**
- Plasma instabilities are expected due to the anisotropic thermal pressures in the expanding solar wind.
- These instabilities may lead to the formation of a **turbulent magnetic shell** surrounding the inner solar system (observed through cosmic ray modulation).

### 5. **Implications for Solar Rotation and Space Weather**
- The interaction between the solar wind and the magnetic field creates a weak **torque on the Sun**, which could gradually slow its rotation over billions of years.
- The study lays the foundation for understanding the heliospheric environment and space weather effects.

## Conclusion
Parker’s analysis provides a theoretical foundation for the **solar wind** and the **interplanetary magnetic field structure**. His findings explain the continuous expansion of the solar atmosphere and the shaping of the Sun’s magnetic influence throughout the heliosphere. The paper is a seminal contribution to space plasma physics and solar-terrestrial interactions.
